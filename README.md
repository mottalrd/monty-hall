# The Monty Hall problem in Ruby

The [Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) is an illustration of how probability
can be completely and utterly counterintuitive. I've had a thousand arguments about this, so I decided to write
a bit of Ruby to model the process, and display the results of a large number of attempts.

The moral of the story: don't trust gameshow hosts, or you're going home with a goat.
